        <!--h3>About Me</h3-->
        <p>Artist and writer Austin Kleon once stated, “Don’t write what you know; write what you love.” And I’ve been doing just that since I first put pencil to paper when I was a little girl.</p>
        <p> Now that I’m a full-grown lady (at 5’1”), I have written about things I hold close to my heart. These things include pop culture, books, movies, and music. I’ve also written about my love of anything DIY, especially cooking, baking, and crafting.
            In addition, I love to write about fashion and beauty.</p>
        <p> On a more serious note, I have also written about politics, my local community, and various social issues from mental health to the environment to various civil rights.</p>
        <p> And all of these topics have fulfilled me not just as a writer, but as a human being. I’ve been fortunate to write about these topics as both a copywriter and a journalist in both the professional and academic realm.</p>

            From <a href="writing/academic.html">academic work</a> to <a href="writing/journalism.html">journalism</a> and <a href="writing/copywriting.html">copywriting</a>, a selection of my work is available <a href="writing/writing.html">here</a>.

        <h3><a href="more/more.html"> … and more!</a></h3>
        <p> But I do more than write. I also fuel myself and my creativity through designing jewelry and my own bath and beauty products. I’m dabbling in paper products, including stationery, book marks and gift wrap, too.</p>
