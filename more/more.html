        <h3>… and more!</h3>
        <p>I do so much more than write. As mentioned on my Home page, I also express my creative soul
            through designing jewelry and creating my very own soap and other bath and beauty products.
        </p>
        <p><h4>Jewelry and Accessories</h4></p>
        <p>I’ve always loved accessories, and for many years I have designed and worn my own custom creations,
            which include earrings, bracelets, necklaces and brooches. I also design Japanese-inspired obi belts
            made of men’s vintage silk ties and am also exploring revamping vintage ladies’ sweaters with my
            collection of beads. I have uploaded photographs of my current designs and am open to designing
            individual jewelry and accessories to interested people looking for something beautiful and unique.
        </p>
        <h4>Bath and Beauty Products</h4>
        <p>I got interested in making my own soap after visiting several local crafting fairs here in the Midwest.
            However, I didn’t want to have dangerous lye lurking in my apartment. Ten years ago I found out I could
            learn how to make soap via the melt and pour method and quickly signed up for a non-credit course at
            my alma mater. Since that fateful day I have not bought bath soap from the store. All of my soap is
            handmade using the best essential oils and colorants. My soaps are made of either glycerin, goats’ milk,
            shea butter of olive oil and any other essential elements including green tea, aloe vera, various fresh
            herbs and other natural elements.<br\>

            I also make my own bath salts and soaks, massage oils, facial masks, deep hair conditioner, hand and
            body butters and exfoliating scrubs.
        </p>
        <h4>But wait, there is more...</h4>
        <p>
            I’m now dabbling in paper products, mainly stationery, gift wrap and gift bags and book marks.
